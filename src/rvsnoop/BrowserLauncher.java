/**
 * Launch a web browser in a cross-platform manner.
 * <p>
 * <code>BrowserLauncher</code> is a class that provides one static method,
 * <code>openURL</code>, which opens the default web browser for the current
 * user of the system to the given URL. It may support other protocols depending
 * on the system -- mailto, ftp, etc. -- but that has not been rigorously tested
 * and is not guaranteed to work.
 * <p>
 * Yes, this is platform-specific code, and yes, it may rely on classes on
 * certain platforms that are not part of the standard JDK. What we're trying to
 * do, though, is to take something that's frequently desirable but inherently
 * platform-specific -- opening a default browser -- and allow programmers (you,
 * for example) to do so without worrying about dropping into native code or
 * doing anything else similarly evil.
 * <p>
 * This version of the class does not handle very old operating systems (e.g Mac
 * Classic or win9x) since they are not supported by RvSnoop. This version of
 * the class has had a lot of functionality removed, if you are considering
 * using this class in an application you should probably grab the full version
 * from SourceForge rather than using this one.
 * <p>
 * This code is Copyright 1999-2001 by Eric Albert (ejalbert@cs.stanford.edu)
