        <h2>Quick Start</h2>
        <p>You can get started by running the scripts in the <em>bin</em> directory, there is one for Windows and one for Unix.</p>
        <p>More detailed information can be found in the <a href="index@suffix@">local help files</a>.</p>
        <h2>Summary of Changes</h2>
        <p>Some general changes in terminology have taken place in the documentation. The tree view on the left of the window is now known as the ‘Subject Explorer’ since that is what it actually shows, and the main table view is the ‘Message Ledger’ since again, that is what it shows. The old ‘Category’ names were a holdover from Log Factor 5. Some areas in the <acronym>UI</acronym> and documentation may still use the old names, if you spot any please <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=63447">mark it as a bug</a> on SourceForge.</p>
        <p>In a similar vein, there has been some class renaming. I feel that this is OK at this stage as RvSn00p has never had a public <acronym>API</acronym> before. The idea is, in broad terms, to introduce some scriptablility around the 2.0 timeframe, and there needs to be a clean public <acronym>API</acronym> before then. For an example of what has changed: <code>rvsn00p.LogRecord</code> is now <code>rvsn00p.Record</code>. There <em>will</em> be more changes like this in the upcoming point releases, but it will cease once 2.0 is announced.</p>
        <p>The standard cut/copy/paste menu actions have been added. Also, it is now possible to delete records from the ledger and to prune empty subjects from the subject explorer.</p>
        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>Please suggest further enhancements via the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=63447">SourceForge tracker</a>.</p>
        <p>Main plans for the next version are the addition of a view of the current listeners, along with listener details and listener specific actions (e.g. pause a single listener). Also, the export to <acronym>HTML</acronym> facility will be altered to use <acronym>XHTML 1.0 Strict</acronym>. Finally, the ability to resend message <em>may</em> be added (this may slip to the following version however).</p>
        <p>There is also ongoing work to clean-up and refactoring the code base with a view to having a public <acronym>API</acronym> as part of the 2.0 release (this will allow scripting).</p>
