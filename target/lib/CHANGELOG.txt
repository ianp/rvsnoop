Changes up to version 1.1.6 Thu Oct 10 22:22:26 CEST 2002

Added:
New help about options: Licence information
Changed implementation of RvMsg string serialization to allow later implemetation 
of editing and resending messages. 

Rvsn00p now uses the first found of: 
- Tibco Rvscript tibrvXmlConvert
- MTree.toString()
- TibRvMsg.toString()

This means that if the rvscript.jar is in the classpath tibrvXmlConvert will be used as 
string serializer. If it is not found the serializer will be downgraded to the Tibco SDK 
AE Mtree format and if that is not not fount the standard RV API TibRvMsg will be used.
